#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Detects a worktree that has outlived its prompt.
#
# Runs as a Stop hook, so it fires when a turn ends. The hard part is telling
# "just entered a worktree, about to work" from "finished, merged, still loitering".
# Both are clean trees, so cleanliness cannot separate them, and neither can
# commits-ahead-of-main: after a squash merge the local commits are not ancestors of
# main, so a finished branch still looks ahead.
#
# Two signals do work, either of which is conclusive:
#
#   1. Upstream gone — the branch was pushed and its remote counterpart deleted,
#      which in this workflow happens exactly on squash-merge.
#   2. Squash-landed — HEAD differs from the base branch but its *tree* is identical,
#      meaning our commits produced content that is already on main. A fresh worktree
#      has HEAD equal to the base, so it does not match.
#
# Signal 2 exists because signal 1 misses a push that did not set an upstream
# (`git push origin HEAD:name`), which is easy to do by accident.
#
# Deliberately silent in every other case — a Stop hook that cries wolf gets ignored,
# and this one can block a turn.
